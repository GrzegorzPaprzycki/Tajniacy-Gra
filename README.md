## TAJNIACY

--------------------

### What is this?

This is my verison of popular board game "Tajniacy".  

### What are the rules?

In this game 2 Teams compete with each other (red and blue). The goal is to reverse all cards in your color.
Every team has 'chef' player. His mission is to describe to other players in his team what card are their. But... he can use only one word a turn.  

Good luck and have fun :)
